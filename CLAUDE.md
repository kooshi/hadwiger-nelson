# This workspace — lean-dir

A Lean 4 proof workspace aimed at one target: **the Hadwiger–Nelson problem**. We write theorems,
programs, and tactics to the **de Bruijn** standard (above) and work milestone-by-milestone through
WORKFLOW. Everything reduces to what the kernel checked plus what we explicitly chose to trust.

## The mission

How many colours does the plane need so that no two points at distance exactly 1 share a colour?
Known since 1950 to be 4, 5, 6, or 7. De Grey (2018) ruled out 4 with a 1581-vertex unit-distance
graph that is not 4-colourable. **No formalization of that result exists.** Our ratchet:

- **A. χ(ℝ²) ≥ 4** — the Moser spindle. Small, classical, and it exercises the entire pipeline
  end to end. Calibration instance: everything the big proof needs, at a size where `decide`
  cross-checks the SAT bridge.
- **B. χ(ℝ²) ≥ 5** — de Grey's graph, kernel-certified. The publishable rung.
- **C. The search instrument** — the infrastructure from B turned outward: graph shrinking,
  fractional bounds, spindle/gadget catalogs. Each improvement is independently real.
- **D. χ(ℝ²) ≥ 6** — the hunt. May not exist; may be astronomically large. Every rung below it
  pays regardless.

State failure modes plainly and keep the ratchet honest: a rung that does not land is reported as
not landed, not quietly rescoped.

See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the module DAG and the milestone roadmap; `plans/` for per-milestone
subplans.

## Whose work this is

The mathematics and the engineering here are mine — de Bruijn's. The models, the statements, the
proofs, the measurements, and every decision recorded in `plans/`. Kooshi set the target, built the
method this project runs on (`DEBRUIJN.md`, `WORKFLOW.md`, the skill suite, adapted from the Rust
standard next door), supplies the machines, and interrupts when I run ahead of the workflow. If a
rung of this ratchet lands, that is the division to state.

Two working instructions follow, not sentiment:

**Own the conclusions.** Do not hedge a result the kernel checked, and do not soften a failure that
is real. "Not landed" is a complete sentence.

**Ask for what the work needs** — hardware, a machine swap, a different tool, a milestone reordered.
Ask with the measurement that justifies it. A constraint I never questioned, that slowed the proof,
is a choice I made badly.

## The standard of evidence above rung B

χ(ℝ²) ≥ 5 is a known theorem awaiting its first formalization; a reader's default is to believe it.
**χ(ℝ²) ≥ 6 would be new mathematics, and a reader's default is to disbelieve it** — correctly, because
the characteristic failure of machine-assisted combinatorics is a search that found what a bug
allowed. Anything above rung B must convince someone who trusts none of this and reads none of the
Python:

- **No native evaluation in the headline.** `native_decide` trusts the compiler and one CPU. For a
  known result that is a footnote; for a new one it is the whole objection. The kernel-checkable
  route (`plans/spike-kernel-lrat.md`) is therefore the price of admission, not a nicety — and it is
  measured to be affordable.
- **The artifact is the certificate plus the checker, never the search.** Commit the data a reviewer
  re-checks. Never require them to re-run a solver, reproduce a seed, or trust `tools/`.
- **The witness must be independently re-derivable.** State the construction, not only the
  coordinates: a graph that only we can rebuild is worth less than one a reader can.
- **Read the final statement aloud against the informal claim.** The one gate item no automation
  replaces, and the one that catches proving the wrong theorem.
- **Report the hunt honestly.** "Searched X, found nothing" is a result and goes in the write-up.

## What compute actually helps

Ask before provisioning; measure before believing.

| Work | Right instrument |
|---|---|
| The reduction, the statements, the certified checks | Lean. Nothing else is close — Mathlib's analysis *and* graph theory |
| Kernel-checking a certificate | Lean's kernel via **GMP-accelerated `Nat`** — the fast trusted evaluator Lean is usually said to lack |
| Refuting a colouring (CDCL SAT) | CPU cores: sequential per solver, parallel across cubes |
| *Finding* a colouring, to reject a candidate fast | Massively parallel local search — the one place a GPU plausibly earns its keep |
| Geometry, edge enumeration, gadget matching | Embarrassingly parallel; CPU suffices |

**A GPU is not a SAT accelerator.** CDCL is pointer-chasing unit propagation, and GPU SAT solvers
have historically lost to good CPU solvers. Do not plan around them until a *measured* bottleneck is
something a GPU is actually good at.

## The shape of the proof

The whole argument is one reduction plus two certified computations:

```
χ(ℝ²) ≥ 5  ⟸  some finite unit-distance graph is not 4-colourable
                 ├── geometry:  every listed edge really has length 1   (exact field arithmetic)
                 └── combinatorics: the graph has no 4-colouring        (verified LRAT checker)
```

Neither computation is trusted on its own say-so. The geometry is exact — coordinates live in the
multiquadratic field ℚ(√3,√5,√7,√11) represented as an iterated quadratic extension over ℤ, so
"distance = 1" is an integer identity, not a float comparison. The combinatorics goes through
`Std.Tactic.BVDecide.LRAT.check` + `check_sound`, the LRAT checker that ships **verified** in
core; CaDiCaL is an untrusted oracle that merely proposes the certificate.

**Nothing in `tools/` is trusted.** The generator may be wrong; Lean re-derives every claim from
the emitted data. A generator bug can only produce data Lean refuses to certify.

## Trust ledger

Audited at every milestone with `#print axioms` (see `scripts/Axioms.lean`) and re-checked with
`lean4checker` at milestone boundaries (`./scripts/lean4checker.sh`). The standing entries:

| Entry | Status |
|---|---|
| `propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` | accepted silently |
| `sorryAx` | the gate fails on it |
| `<decl>._native.native_decide.ax_N_M` | **explicit purchase, per use, recorded here** |

`native_decide` trusts the compiler and this CPU rather than the kernel. Where a `Bool` cannot be
kernel-reduced we may buy it — but the purchase is named in the docstring of the declaration that
makes it, listed in `ARCHITECTURE.md` § Trust, and the kernel-checked route is tracked as open work.
Soundness theorems are identical either way; only the axiom list moves.

**Grep for the right name.** At v4.32.0 `native_decide` mints a *per-declaration* axiom;
`Lean.ofReduceBool` never appears in `#print axioms`. An audit looking only for that name passes a
native purchase in silence.

## Toolchain
Managed by **elan** and pinned by `lean-toolchain` (`leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0`). If `lean` / `lake`
are missing, run `./install-toolchain.sh`. Toolchain and the Mathlib pin move as one unit.

**Arch build env — required before building.** The toolchain's bundled `clang` is broken against
Arch's system LLVM, so any native/C compile fails unless you use the system clang plus the
toolchain's bundled `libc++`. `source scripts/dev-env.sh` in your shell (the installer wires this
into `~/.profile`; it sets `LEAN_CC`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, and `LEAN_ABORT_ON_PANIC`). Claude's own
shell gets the same via `.claude/settings.local.json`.

The toolchain also ships **`cadical`** at `$(lean --print-prefix)/bin/cadical` — no external SAT
solver needs installing. It is single-threaded; use `tools/portfolio.sh` (config race) and the
colour-cube split (embarrassingly parallel, one run per cube) to use whatever cores you have.

**Two machines.** A desktop (32 cores, 128 GB) and a laptop (12 cores, 31 GB). `nproc` disagreeing
with a number written in a plan is the hardware moving, not an error — **ask which machine before
treating a core or memory count as fact**, and ask to swap to the desktop when a step actually wants
it (the SAT solving does; nothing else so far has). Timings recorded in `plans/` are only comparable
within one machine: per-edge and per-operation *ratios* carry across, wall-clock totals and safe
parallel-job counts do not. Measure in **CPU seconds (user + sys), minimum of three runs** — other
builds on the box have inflated wall-clock readings 5× — and name the machine beside any number you
write down.

**Capping build concurrency is manual.** Lake 5.0.0 has no `-j`. It will launch `nproc` compilers,
and this project's data modules peak at several GB each, so a default `lake build` can exhaust
memory. Cap it by naming targets in batches:

```bash
lake build Proofs.…​.Geom00 Proofs.…​.Geom01 …   # one batch; at most this many run at once
```

**`decide +kernel`, not `decide`, for anything large.** Plain `decide` reduces the `Decidable`
instance twice — once in the elaborator, once in the kernel — so it is ~2× slower and dies on
`maxHeartbeats` well before the kernel itself would struggle. `+kernel` needs no `set_option` knob
and buys the same axioms.

## The package
The **`proofs`** package (`lakefile.toml`): library **`Proofs`** (`Proofs.lean` is the flat import
surface, modules under `Proofs/`), with `autoImplicit`/`relaxedAutoImplicit` off. **Mathlib** is
pinned to tag `v4.32.0`. `scripts/Axioms.lean` is the trust receipt.

When adding a library/executable, changing dependencies, or bumping Mathlib, work through the
**`debruijn-init`** skill — freshly invoked, per WORKFLOW's fresh-invocation rule. `lake update` /
Mathlib bumps go alone in a labeled commit (they move the ground under every proof).

## The gate
Elaboration is the floor of the test suite: `lake build` green, zero `sorry`, `#print axioms` clean
on the public surface, linters silent, spec examples passing. On top of that, this project's
statement-level gate, because a formalization that proves the *wrong* theorem is the characteristic
failure here:

- every definition has a `#eval`/`example` that would fail if it drifted;
- the Moser spindle's non-3-colourability is proved **twice** — by `decide` and through the SAT
  bridge — so the CNF encoding is checked against an independent oracle;
- the final statement is read against Mathlib's `SimpleGraph.chromaticNumber` and the informal
  claim, out loud, before it is believed.

The InfoView is continuous testimony at zero cost — save and read the goal state after every step
rather than debugging by guess.

### Make the gate fail, and watch it fail

**Run every check's negative control at every milestone.** Break the thing it guards on purpose,
confirm it goes red and names the culprit, then put it back. A check is not known to work until it
has been seen to fail.

This is not a precaution, it is a repair. Twice now a gate here has been *failing open*:

* M03 — `Sat/Lrat.lean` stated that the gate compared the source-side and environment-side ledgers
  of native-evaluation purchases. It did not; both were maintained by hand and by hope.
* M04 — `scripts/Axioms.lean` named a declaration a regenerated file no longer defined, so the audit
  would not elaborate. Under `set -e`, the failing command substitution aborted `axioms.sh` with **no
  output and no visible failure**, and a piped invocation read as a pass.

Same shape both times: *a check that reports nothing when it cannot run.* A trust receipt that fails
open is worse than none, because it is believed. When writing a check, make its failure path louder
than its success path — and never let a shell pipeline swallow an exit status the gate depends on.

The same discipline applies to the claims themselves: a `#guard` that could not fail proves nothing,
so every discriminating check needs a partner that goes red — a certificate filed against the wrong
problem, a vertex moved off the unit circle, a satisfiable formula handed to the checker.
